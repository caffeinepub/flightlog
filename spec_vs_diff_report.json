  "summary": "The diff addresses all four requirements. REQ-3 and REQ-4 (frontend fixes) are clearly implemented in useQueries.ts, FlightRecordsTable.tsx, and EditFlightEntryModal.tsx. The backend file (backend/main.mo) is modified, but the diff is truncated so full verification of REQ-1 and REQ-2 backend fixes is limited. Based on available evidence, the fixes appear to be in place. No hallucinated features are detected.",
