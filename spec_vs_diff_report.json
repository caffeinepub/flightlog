  "summary": "The diff implements the vast majority of the requested requirements. All core features are present: Internet Identity authentication, backend Motoko actor with per-user scoped data, List Manager UI reused for all four categories, Flight Log Entry form with computed total flight time, Flight Records view with filtering, Main Menu navigation, and aviation-themed styling. A few minor acceptance criteria gaps are noted below.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "REQ-2: Separate named functions addStudent, updateStudent, deleteStudent, listStudents (and equivalents for instructor, aircraft, exercise) — the backend uses generic addCategory, deleteCategory, listCategories functions rather than the specifically-named per-category functions required by the ACs.",
      "reason": "The backend (backend/main.mo) exposes addCategory, deleteCategory, listCategories accepting a categoryType string rather than the distinct named functions addStudent/updateStudent/deleteStudent/listStudents etc. called out in the acceptance criteria.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo",
        "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts"

    },
    {
      "requirement": "REQ-3: addFlightLog / getFlightLogs function names — the ACs specify addFlightLog and getFlightLogs but the implementation uses addFlightEntry and getFlightEntries.",
      "reason": "Acceptance criteria explicitly call for functions named addFlightLog and getFlightLogs; the diff shows addFlightEntry and getFlightEntries instead.",
